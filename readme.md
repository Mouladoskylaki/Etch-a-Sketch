# Etch-a-Sketch Project

## Introduction

This project is a browser-based version of an Etch-a-Sketch, created to practice DOM manipulation skills using JavaScript and CSS Flexbox. Users can draw on a grid that changes color as the mouse hovers over the squares.

## Features

- A grid of square divs is dynamically generated using JavaScript.
- The grid layout is styled using CSS Flexbox.
- A hover effect changes the color of the grid squares when the mouse passes over them, mimicking a drawing effect.
- A button allows the user to input a new grid size (up to 100x100), which dynamically updates the grid.

## Extra Credit Features

- Randomized RGB values for the squares on mouse interaction.
- Progressive darkening effect with each interaction, achieving a fully black square in ten interactions.
